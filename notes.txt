General:

Consider leaving out reviews, because you know why you hate that shit
Also leave out payment, because it isn't necessary for MVP
What you need for MVP is a damn good interface, the ability to search for the right venuse/bookers/deejays/events, and set up COMMUNICATION between the right parties. The rest will follow. No need to clutter your application with unnecessary features.

Think about how to use the calendar component for multiple use cases. One way could be instead of using buttons with dropdown menus for each type of gig, could just render the calendar and COLOR CODE each type. You click a button and it filters to only show gigs of that type. Click a cell on the calendar and it takes you to a "Day" component with a list of gigs for that day. This is most useful for bookers who might be booking multiple deejays for a given night (different riders, time slots, communications, etc).

/////// CURRENT STEPS ////////

= INPUT + VALIDATION
    Sequelize model constraints
    Reg Ex study
    change phone input fields to three input fields, each only taking 3-4-3 digits
    change date input field to drop-downs with pre-determined options (mm-dd-yyyy)
    change time input field to drop-downs with pre-determined options (hh-mm-//)

FILTER + SEARCH
    use datefns to determine past/future status, add flag to Sequelize model
    filter gigs into lists based on past, upcoming, open
    search any gig list to match text input (name, location, booker/deejay)
    search any gig list to match date range (input via two sets of dropdowns)
    search any gig list to match compensation minimum (input via textbox)

UI UX UI UX UI UX UI UX UI UX UI UX
    color Scheme
    button types
    layout

BROWSE OPEN GIGS (UI/UX TBD).
    default renders a list of all open gigs in chronological order
    option to select date/date range via calendar
    option to search based on all fields (name, location, booker/deejay, etc)
    calendar should render only these dates

CALENDAR - (the calendar is the centerpiece of the deejay/booker home. will take some time)
    ((*hierarchy of filter/browse/calendar ??))
    greyed out "+ new gig" button on each cell
    greyed out "view gigs" button on each cell
    hover over each cell and select appropriate button
    +

APPLY/ACCEPT GIG
    simple "request" button on each open gig
    clicking "request" button sets a "pending" flag on that gig
    create a "requests" list that renders on deejay/booker homepage - a gig list specifically for invites
    accepting/declining a gig will add the correct deejayId/bookerId to that gig
    ~maybe have a separate tab for "history" - i.e. all past gigs, both declined, pending, and accepted

MESSAGING
    one chatbox per gig
    keep the layout dead simple

SEED FILE
    multiple instances of all types of each model

ERROR MESSAGES
    for bad inputs
