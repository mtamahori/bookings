GENERAL:

// OPEN 12/19/18
SEARCH FILTER: currently WIP. see Gig-Main for early version of filter being implemented under Browse Gigs

need to clean up component hierarchy of FILTER / GIG LIST / etc.
could also just remove the GIGLIST from NAVBAR - only gonna need gig list if already in BOOKER or DEEJAY mode



// OPEN 12/13/18
also need to create some condition for not allowing a user to hit the 'bookers/new' route if they have a booker profile.

  (protect against the front-end route by checking state for a user's booker id)
  (protect backend by making a constraint on the models; allow only one deejay/booker id per user)
// DONE 12/17/18

// OPEN 12/13/18
need to redirect to '/bookers' from '/bookers/new' after submit (use history.push?)
// DONE 12/14/18
