General:

Consider leaving out reviews, because you know why you hate that shit
Also leave out payment, because it isn't necessary for MVP
What you need for MVP is a damn good interface, the ability to search for the right venuse/bookers/deejays/events, and set up COMMUNICATION between the right parties. The rest will follow. No need to clutter your application with unnecessary features.



//////////////////////////////////////// TIME AND DATE

Calendar - study CSS and make the styling more your own
    Feature: click on a date, and the relevant gig lists will render. Gotta think about how to format this. You can view stuff that pertains to you, stuff that pertains to that date, ...

RegEX / Datefns:
    need to be able to verify date input information per gig
    need to match and filter past and future gigs
